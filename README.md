Terraform projects for AWS 

Each project is supplied with run.py file which can be run to walk you through the terraform process

Before running the terraform add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as your environment variables

for example create a file called env.vars:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""

export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""

After pasting in the values run the following command:
source env.vars
